# The Add to Calendar Button - optimized for Vue 3

This is a wrapper repository for the popular [Add to Calendar Button](), making it even more convenient, to create beautiful buttons in Vue, where people can add events to their calendars.

<br /><br />

This is for everybody, who wants to include a button at their Vue.js application, which enables users to easily add a specific event to their calendars.
The main goal of this repository is to keep this process as easy as possible at maximum compatibility. Simply define your button configuration and everything else is automatically generated by the script.
Supporting calendars at Apple, Google, Microsoft (365, Outlook, Teams), Yahoo, and generic iCal.

![Supported Calendars: Apple (via iCal), Google, Microsoft (365, Outlook, Teams), Yahoo, generic iCal](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button-vue/blob/main/assets/badge-supported-calendars.svg)

In terms of system support, **all modern browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) on **Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS** as well as rather restricted webview environments like the **Instagram** in-app browser are supported.

## üì¶ Installation

Import the package using the following npm command:

```
npm install add-to-calendar-button-vue
```

<br /><br />

## üéõÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

Import the component wherever you want to use it:

```
import AddToCalendarButton from 'add-to-calendar-button-vue';
```

Use the componet inside your code and declare any options as attributes.

```
<add-to-calendar-button
  name="Test-Event"
  startDate="2023-05-22"
  :options="['Apple','Google','Yahoo','iCal']"
></add-to-calendar-button>
```

Mind that for images, options, and customLabels, you would need to add ":" before the props name (v-bind). Otherwise, Vue would not recognize them as Arrays and Objects, but Strings (see [Vue Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html#props-declaration) for details).

<!--If you want to not pass the props via the component element, you can also simply fall back to the JSON style of main Add to Calendar Button script. Keep on including the Vue component, but instead of using `<add-to-calendar-button></add-to-calendar-button>`, you use the following syntax:

```
<add-to-calendar-button>
  {
    "name":"Add the title of your event",
    "startDate":"2023-05-22",
    "options":[
      "Apple",
      "Google",
      "Yahoo",
      "iCal"
    ]
  }
</add-to-calendar-button>
```-->

<br /><br />
